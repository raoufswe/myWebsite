It has been a couple of months since I have started learning **Node.js** and it has been a fantastic experience so far. 

As anyone new in programming should do, learning by doing projects is helpful, and it speeds up the learning process exponentially. So, I came up with an idea to develop an Online Incident Reporting System that allows the management of the incident reporting process. 

The web application is more likely a **Content Management System** in which users need to register first and log in to able to report an incident, edit or delete it as well as view all incidents submitted by other users. 

By the time I was halfway in the development process, I was studying a Computer System Security module in the university, and its assignment was to create an application with any programming language the student chooses and implement security features. 

So, I had to put more time and effort to finish the project idea and implement the security features. The implemented security features are password hashing, reCAPTCHA, Cross-site scripting prevention, HTTP headers setting and NoSQL injection as the database is MongoDB.

The system is not the most sophisticated web application on the internet, yet it is very overwhelming to see yourself developing ‘A fully functioning system’ compared to your level of experience. 

Finally, learning to code is a long journey, and with determination and patience, everyone can do it! 

Here is a live demo of the system and feel free to check or use the source code in my GitHub account.
